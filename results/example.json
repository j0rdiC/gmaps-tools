Showed me the price 4 times, showed me even the screen to see that this is the price when I said I don't care just want to send the package he stopped. Very unpleasant and rude."

But Spain is a bit of a challenge for pc gamers. when pc parts are shipped to Spain they get 21!!!% VAT that\u2019s just absurd but that is with all goods in Spain."
